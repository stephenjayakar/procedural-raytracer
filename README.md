# procedural-raytracer

A procedural raytracer which is a fork of my own project the [rust-raytracer](https://github.com/stephenjayakar/rust-raytracer). This is intended to be able to generate new screens forever of greyscale cubes. The primary intention for this project is to be displayed on an E-ink display throughout the day.
